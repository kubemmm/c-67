Once upon a time, there lived a rabbit and tortoise. The rabbit could run fast. He was very proud of his speed. While the turtle was slow and consistent. 

One day that tortoise came to meet him. The tortoise was walking very slow as usual. The rabbit looked and laughed at him. The tortoise asked “what happened?”

The rabbit replied, “You walk so slowly! How can you survive like this?”. 

The turtle listened to everything and felt humiliated by the rabbit’s words. The rabbit was surprised by the challenge of the tortoise. But he accepted the challenge as he thought it would be a cakewalk for him.

So, the tortoise and rabbit started the race. The rabbit was as usual very fast and went far away. While the tortoise was left behind. 

After a while, the rabbit looked behind. 

He said to himself, “The slow turtle will take ages to come near me. I should rest a bit”. 

The rabbit was tired from running fast. The sun was high too. He ate some grass and decided to take a nap. 

He said to himself, “I am confident; I can win even if the tortoise passes me. I should rest a bit”. With that thought, he slept and lost the track of time.
