Once upon a time, there lived a rabbit and tortoise. The rabbit could run fast. He was very proud of his speed. While the turtle was slow and consistent. 

One day that tortoise came to meet him. The tortoise was walking very slow as usual. The rabbit looked and laughed at him. The tortoise asked “what happened?”

The rabbit replied, “You walk so slowly! How can you survive like this?”. 

The turtle listened to everything and felt humiliated by the rabbit’s words.
